### Simple server-side application

It's an express application that gets the blog posts making a server-side request.

Into `example/server-side` folder

```bash
$ cd example/server-side
```

... download npm dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

... run the application

```bash
$ node index.js
```

Finally open a browser and load the page pointing to http://localhost:3000
Keep in mind that this app gets the config data from test/data.json file
